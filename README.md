# Challenge #1 (due 11/23/2015): Hello W@#$!?
Saw a similar challenge to this one on www.codewars.com and though it would be a good one to kick off this round of code challenges.

## Description
In order to stop too much communication from happening, your overlords declare that you are no longer allowed to use certain functionality in your code!

Disallowed functionality:
* Strings or Chars
* Numbers (including binary)
* Loading pre-existing images, text, or other data files from within your own solution
* Regular Expressions
* Functions, classes, or objects named "Hello", "World", "HelloWorld" or anything similar (including concatenating multiple names using some form of reflection).
* Without using the above, output "Hello World!" to prove that there is always a way.

## Bonus Entry
Submit a solution with fewer than 1000 characters of core program logic (excludes comments, whitespace, unit tests, etc.).  No minifying, please.
