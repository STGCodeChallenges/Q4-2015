# Challenge #1 (due 11/23/2015): Hello W@#$!?
Saw a similar challenge to this one on www.codewars.com and though it would be a good one to kick off this round of code challenges.

# Description
In order to stop too much communication from happening, your overlords declare that you are no longer allowed to use certain functionality in your code!

Disallowed functionality:
Strings or Chars
Numbers (including binary)
Loading pre-existing images, text, or other data files from within your own solution
Regular Expressions
Functions, classes, or objects named "Hello", "World", "HelloWorld" or anything similar (including concatenating multiple names using some form of reflection).
Without using the above, output "Hello World!" to prove that there is always a way.

# Bonus Entry
Submit a solution with fewer than 1000 characters of core program logic (excludes comments, whitespace, unit tests, etc.).  No minifying, please.
